# 🏥 Patient Readmission Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview
This project explores hospital data to identify the key factors that contribute to patient readmissions within 30 days. The goal is to provide actionable insights that hospitals can use to reduce avoidable readmissions.

## 🧰 Tools Used
- Python (pandas, matplotlib, seaborn)
- Google Colab
- Tableau Public (for visualization)

## 🧪 Dataset
- **Source:** UCI Diabetes Readmission Dataset  
- [Link to dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/diabetes+130-us+hospitals+for+years+1999-2008)

## 🔍 Key Steps
1. Data Cleaning: Removed irrelevant columns, handled missing values
2. Exploratory Data Analysis: Analyzed age, diagnoses, hospital stay, medications
3. Visualization: Created charts showing patterns in readmissions
4. Recommendations: Suggested actions based on findings

## 📈 Sample Insights
- Patients aged 70+ had the highest readmission risk
- Longer hospital stays slightly correlated with higher readmission
- Some medications and diagnoses were strongly associated with readmission

## 📎 Files Included
- `notebook.ipynb`: Python analysis notebook (Google Colab)
- `cleaned_data.csv`: Cleaned version of the dataset
- `dashboard_link.txt`: Link to Tableau dashboard (optional)

## ✅ Conclusion
This project simulates a real-world healthcare analysis task and demonstrates core data analyst skills — data wrangling, visualization, and business interpretation.



# 📝 Patient Readmission Analysis – Portfolio Project Summary

**Project Goal:**  
To analyze hospital patient data to identify key factors behind 30-day readmission and suggest actionable improvements in patient care, especially for high-risk groups.

**Tools Used:**  
Microsoft Excel for data cleaning and analysis  
Tableau Public for visualization and dashboard creation

**Steps Taken:**

- Cleaned over 100,000 rows of hospital patient data in Excel  
- Removed irrelevant columns and handled missing values  
- Performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to discover patterns by age, diagnosis, and stay duration  
- Created visual dashboards in Tableau Public to present key trends and insights

**Key Insights:**

- Patients aged 70 and above had the highest readmission rates  
- Longer hospital stays often correlated with higher readmission likelihood  
- Specific diagnoses (e.g., diabetes, heart failure) appeared frequently in readmitted cases  
- Gender and discharge type had minor but noticeable influence on outcomes

**Recommendations:**

- Implement targeted discharge planning and education for patients over 70  
- Enhance follow-up programs for long-stay or chronically ill patients  
- Review medication protocols and educate patients on high-risk prescriptions  
- Improve communication between departments to reduce early readmissions
