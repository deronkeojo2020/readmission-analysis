# üìù Patient Readmission Analysis ‚Äì Portfolio Project Summary

**Project Goal:**  
To analyze hospital patient data to identify key factors behind 30-day readmission and suggest actionable improvements in patient care, especially for high-risk groups.

**Tools Used:**  
Microsoft Excel for data cleaning and analysis  
Tableau Public for visualization and dashboard creation

**Steps Taken:**

- Cleaned over 100,000 rows of hospital patient data in Excel  
- Removed irrelevant columns and handled missing values  
- Performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to discover patterns by age, diagnosis, and stay duration  
- Created visual dashboards in Tableau Public to present key trends and insights

**Key Insights:**

- Patients aged 70 and above had the highest readmission rates  
- Longer hospital stays often correlated with higher readmission likelihood  
- Specific diagnoses (e.g., diabetes, heart failure) appeared frequently in readmitted cases  
- Gender and discharge type had minor but noticeable influence on outcomes

**Recommendations:**

- Implement targeted discharge planning and education for patients over 70  
- Enhance follow-up programs for long-stay or chronically ill patients  
- Review medication protocols and educate patients on high-risk prescriptions  
- Improve communication between departments to reduce early readmissions
